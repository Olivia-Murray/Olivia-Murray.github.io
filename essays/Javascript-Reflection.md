## Javascript is Easy!
Before learning anything about Javascript, I was not sure of what to expect.  I had heard people talk of Javascript in such a negative way, but yet others quite enjoyed coding in it.  However, once I started the tutorial on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>, I was amazed at how fast I was learning.  It was simpler to learn compared to Java.  I would recommend a person who is just starting their journey through code to learn Javascript first, before attempting any other language.  If you're like me and know how to program in at least one programming language, in my opinion Javascript is very easy to learn.  I have never touched Javascript before taking ICS 314 Software Engineering.  However, I knew how to code in Java and I find Javascript to be very similar, but easier.  One example is that you do not have to worry about return types.  I am genuinely excited to learn all that I can do with Javascript.  I have not learned enough to know whether it is a good or bad programming language with respect to software engineering, but I'm sure it is coming soon.

## Working Out Our Brains
In this class, we practice athletic software engineering.  Modeled after Crossfit, each week we are given a challenge called a Workout of the Day (WOD) in which we have only a certain amount of time to complete it.  I completely understand the reason behind it.  If we train ourselves now to be completely calm and clear headed in a high stress and time sensitive situation, we can be better prepared for when it happens in real-life scenarios.  I felt that the practice WODs helped to prepare me for the graded WOD, but during the actual WOD I had a hiccup and could not see my mistake fast enough, therefore only making average time.  It is my goal to get better and be as fast and efficient as possible, because that is how I wish to be when it comes to the workplace.  In a saying I once heard, *Practice does not make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.*  And so I will try my best, whether it be in the classroom or out.
