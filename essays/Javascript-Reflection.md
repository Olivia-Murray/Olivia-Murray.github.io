So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

If you know how to program, even the slightest in almost any language, in my opinion Javascript is an easy language to learn.  I have never touched Javascript before taking ICS 314 Software Engineering.  However, I knew how to code in Java and I find Javascript to be very similar, but easier.  One example is that you do not have to worry about return types.  Before learning anything about Javascript, I was not sure of what to expect.  I had heard people talk of it in such a negative way, but yet others quite enjoyed coding in Javascript.  

Once I started the tutorial on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>, I was amazed at how fast I was learning.
