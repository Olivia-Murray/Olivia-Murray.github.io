This was my first ICS 111 coding project that really got me interested in ICS. The goal of this game is click keys “A” and “D” (A and then D or D and then A, not at the same time) as fast as possible to move across the screen. The game starts as I hear the announcer start the countdown, the “leader” will be updated once a new leader has taken first place.
