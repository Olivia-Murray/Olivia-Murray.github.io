Wash-N-Dash is an app made specifically for UH Manoa students who dorm. Wash-N-Dash allows one to see the status of their laundry from any device that can connect to the web.  It can filter out different machines based on location or type, so you only see what you want to see.  It can also help you find a laundry room if you are new. Through this app, one can report a machine. The administrative side of this application can manage the washers and dryers, disabling it if needed. Wash-N-Dash was created using Meteor and ReactJs. The application works by detecting which machines are currently in use by either user reporting or a raspberry pi and giving an estimated time of completion. 

This project was a group effort, although early in development I suffered a mild concussion, which severely impacted my allowed screen time. I did not contribute as much code wise as I would have liked, but it was a learning experience to help in a more hands off way. If I were to have done this project again, I would have tried to get more done earlier. This was my first big project using Meteor, and so far, I enjoy using it.
